       * The Camera is the way in which all games are rendered in Phaser. They provide a view into your game world,
       * and can be positioned, rotated, zoomed and scrolled accordingly.
       *
       * A Camera consists of two elements: The viewport and the scroll values.
       *
       * The viewport is the physical position and size of the Camera within your game. Cameras, by default, are
       * created the same size as your game, but their position and size can be set to anything. This means if you
       * wanted to create a camera that was 320x200 in size, positioned in the bottom-right corner of your game,
       * you'd adjust the viewport to do that (using methods like `setViewport` and `setSize`).
       *
       * If you wish to change where the Camera is looking in your game, then you scroll it. You can do this
       * via the properties `scrollX` and `scrollY` or the method `setScroll`. Scrolling has no impact on the
       * viewport, and changing the viewport has no impact on the scrolling.

       * The Camera is the way in which all games are rendered in Phaser. They provide a view into your game world,
       * and can be positioned, rotated, zoomed and scrolled accordingly.
       *
       * A Camera consists of two elements: The viewport and the scroll values.
       *
       * The viewport is the physical position and size of the Camera within your game. Cameras, by default, are
       * created the same size as your game, but their position and size can be set to anything. This means if you
       * wanted to create a camera that was 320x200 in size, positioned in the bottom-right corner of your game,
       * you'd adjust the viewport to do that (using methods like `setViewport` and `setSize`).
       *
       * If you wish to change where the Camera is looking in your game, then you scroll it. You can do this
       * via the properties `scrollX` and `scrollY` or the method `setScroll`. Scrolling has no impact on the
       * viewport, and changing the viewport has no impact on the scrolling.
       *
       * By default a Camera will render all Game Objects it can see. You can change this using the `ignore` method,
       * allowing you to filter Game Objects out on a per-Camera basis.
       *
       * A Camera also has built-in special effects including Fade, Flash and Camera Shake.

       * The Camera Manager is a plugin that belongs to a Scene and is responsible for managing all of the Scene Cameras.
       *
       * By default you can access the Camera Manager from within a Scene using `this.cameras`, although this can be changed
       * in your game config.
       *
       * Create new Cameras using the `add` method. Or extend the Camera class with your own addition code and then add
       * the new Camera in using the `addExisting` method.
       *
       * Cameras provide a view into your game world, and can be positioned, rotated, zoomed and scrolled accordingly.
       *
       * A Camera consists of two elements: The viewport and the scroll values.
       *
       * The viewport is the physical position and size of the Camera within your game. Cameras, by default, are
       * created the same size as your game, but their position and size can be set to anything. This means if you
       * wanted to create a camera that was 320x200 in size, positioned in the bottom-right corner of your game,
       * you'd adjust the viewport to do that (using methods like `setViewport` and `setSize`).
       *
       * If you wish to change where the Camera is looking in your game, then you scroll it. You can do this
       * via the properties `scrollX` and `scrollY` or the method `setScroll`. Scrolling has no impact on the
       * viewport, and changing the viewport has no impact on the scrolling.
       *
       * By default a Camera will render all Game Objects it can see. You can change this using the `ignore` method,
       * allowing you to filter Game Objects out on a per-Camera basis. The Camera Manager can manage up to 31 unique
       * 'Game Object ignore capable' Cameras. Any Cameras beyond 31 that you create will all be given a Camera ID of
       * zero, meaning that they cannot be used for Game Object exclusion. This means if you need your Camera to ignore
       * Game Objects, make sure it's one of the first 31 created.
       *
       * A Camera also has built-in special effects including Fade, Flash, Camera Shake, Pan and Zoom.

       * A Bitmap Mask combines the alpha (opacity) of a masked pixel with the alpha of another pixel.
       * Unlike the Geometry Mask, which is a clipping path, a Bitmap Mask behaves like an alpha mask,
       * not a clipping path. It is only available when using the WebGL Renderer.
       *
       * A Bitmap Mask can use any Game Object to determine the alpha of each pixel of the masked Game Object(s).
       * For any given point of a masked Game Object's texture, the pixel's alpha will be multiplied by the alpha
       * of the pixel at the same position in the Bitmap Mask's Game Object. The color of the pixel from the
       * Bitmap Mask doesn't matter.
       *
       * For example, if a pure blue pixel with an alpha of 0.95 is masked with a pure red pixel with an
       * alpha of 0.5, the resulting pixel will be pure blue with an alpha of 0.475. Naturally, this means
       * that a pixel in the mask with an alpha of 0 will hide the corresponding pixel in all masked Game Objects
       *  A pixel with an alpha of 1 in the masked Game Object will receive the same alpha as the
       * corresponding pixel in the mask.
       *
       * The Bitmap Mask's location matches the location of its Game Object, not the location of the
       * masked objects. Moving or transforming the underlying Game Object will change the mask
       * (and affect the visibility of any masked objects), whereas moving or transforming a masked object
       * will not affect the mask.
       *
       * The Bitmap Mask will not render its Game Object by itself. If the Game Object is not in a
       * Scene's display list, it will only be used for the mask and its full texture will not be directly
       * visible. Adding the underlying Game Object to a Scene will not cause any problems - it will

     * BitmapText objects work by taking a texture file and an XML or JSON file that describes the font structure.
     *
     * During rendering for each letter of the text is rendered to the display, proportionally spaced out and aligned to
     * match the font structure.
     *
     * Dynamic Bitmap Text objects are different from Static Bitmap Text in that they invoke a callback for each
     * letter being rendered during the render pass. This callback allows you to manipulate the properties of
     * each letter being rendered, such as its position, scale or tint, allowing you to create interesting effects
     * like jiggling text, which can't be done with Static text. This means that Dynamic Text takes more processing
     * time, so only use them if you require the callback ability they have.
     *
     * BitmapText objects are less flexible than Text objects, in that they have less features such as shadows, fills and the ability
     * to use Web Fonts, however you trade this flexibility for rendering speed. You can also create visually compelling BitmapTexts by
     * processing the font texture in an image editor, applying fills and any other effects required.
     *
     * To create multi-line text insert \r, \n or \r\n escape codes into the text string.
     *
     * To create a BitmapText data files you need a 3rd party app such as:
     *
     * BMFont (Windows, free): http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/
     * Glyph Designer (OS X, commercial): http://www.71squared.com/en/glyphdesigner
     * Littera (Web-based, free): http://kvazars.com/littera/
     *
     * For most use cases it is recommended to use XML. If you wish to use JSON, the formatting should be equal to the result of
     * converting a valid XML file through the popular X2JS library. An online tool for conversion can be found here: http://codebeautify.org/xmltojson

     * A Container Game Object.
     *
     * A Container, as the name implies, can 'contain' other types of Game Object.
     * When a Game Object is added to a Container, the Container becomes responsible for the rendering of it.
     * By default it will be removed from the Display List and instead added to the Containers own internal list.
     *
     * The position of the Game Object automatically becomes relative to the position of the Container.
     *
     * When the Container is rendered, all of its children are rendered as well, in the order in which they exist
     * within the Container. Container children can be repositioned using methods such as `MoveUp`, `MoveDown` and `SendToBack`.
     *
     * If you modify a transform property of the Container, such as `Container.x` or `Container.rotation` then it will
     * automatically influence all children as well.
     *
     * Containers can include other Containers for deeply nested transforms.
     *
     * Containers can have masks set on them and can be used as a mask too. However, Container children cannot be masked.
     * The masks do not 'stack up'. Only a Container on the root of the display list will use its mask.
     *
     * Containers can be enabled for input. Because they do not have a texture you need to provide a shape for them
     * to use as their hit area. Container children can also be enabled for input, independent of the Container.
     *
     * Containers can be given a physics body for either Arcade Physics, Impact Physics or Matter Physics. However,
     * if Container _children_ are enabled for physics you may get unexpected results, such as offset bodies,
     * if the Container itself, or any of its ancestors, is positioned anywhere other than at 0 x 0. Container children
     * with physics do not factor in the Container due to the excessive extra calculations needed. Please structure
     * your game to work around this.
     *
     * It's important to understand the impact of using Containers. They add additional processing overhead into
     * every one of their children. The deeper you nest them, the more the cost escalates. This is especially true
     * for input events. You also loose the ability to set the display depth of Container children in the same
     * flexible manner as those not within them. In short, don't use them for the sake of it. You pay a small cost
     * every time you create one, try to structure your game around avoiding that where possible.

     * DOM Element Game Objects are a way to control and manipulate HTML Elements over the top of your game.
     *
     * In order for DOM Elements to display you have to enable them by adding the following to your game
     * configuration object:
     *
     * ```javascript
     * dom {
     *   createContainer: true
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * When this is added, Phaser will automatically create a DOM Container div that is positioned over the top
     * of the game canvas. This div is sized to match the canvas, and if the canvas size changes, as a result of
     * settings within the Scale Manager, the dom container is resized accordingly.
     *
     * You can create a DOM Element by either passing in DOMStrings, or by passing in a reference to an existing
     * Element that you wish to be placed under the control of Phaser. For example:
     *
     * ```javascript
     * this.add.dom(x, y, 'div', 'background-color: lime; width: 220px; height: 100px; font: 48px Arial', 'Phaser');
     * ```
     *
     * The above code will insert a div element into the DOM Container at the given x/y coordinate. The DOMString in
     * the 4th argument sets the initial CSS style of the div and the final argument is the inner text. In this case,
     * it will create a lime colored div that is 220px by 100px in size with the text Phaser in it, in an Arial font.
     *
     * You should nearly always, without exception, use explicitly sized HTML Elements, in order to fully control
     * alignment and positioning of the elements next to regular game content.
     *
     * Rather than specify the CSS and HTML directly you can use the `load.html` File Loader to load it into the
     * cache and then use the `createFromCache` method instead. You can also use `createFromHTML` and various other
     * methods available in this class to help construct your elements.
     *
     * Once the element has been created you can then control it like you would any other Game Object. You can set its
     * position, scale, rotation, alpha and other properties. It will move as the main Scene Camera moves and be clipped
     * at the edge of the canvas. It's important to remember some limitations of DOM Elements: The obvious one is that
     * they appear above or below your game canvas. You cannot blend them into the display list, meaning you cannot have
     * a DOM Element, then a Sprite, then another DOM Element behind it.
     *
     * They also cannot be enabled for input. To do that, you have to use the `addListener` method to add native event
     * listeners directly. The final limitation is to do with cameras. The DOM Container is sized to match the game canvas
     * entirely and clipped accordingly. DOM Elements respect camera scrolling and scrollFactor settings, but if you
     * change the size of the camera so it no longer matches the size of the canvas, they won't be clipped accordingly.
     *
     * Also, all DOM Elements are inserted into the same DOM Container, regardless of which Scene they are created in.
     *
     * DOM Elements are a powerful way to align native HTML with your Phaser Game Objects. For example, you can insert
     * a login form for a multiplayer game directly into your title screen. Or a text input box for a highscore table.
     * Or a banner ad from a 3rd party service. Or perhaps you'd like to use them for high resolution text display and
     * UI. The choice is up to you, just remember that you're dealing with standard HTML and CSS floating over the top
     * of your game, and should treat it accordingly.

       * During rendering for each letter of the text is rendered to the display, proportionally spaced out and aligned to
       * match the font structure.
       *
       * Dynamic Bitmap Text objects are different from Static Bitmap Text in that they invoke a callback for each
       * letter being rendered during the render pass. This callback allows you to manipulate the properties of
       * each letter being rendered, such as its position, scale or tint, allowing you to create interesting effects
       * like jiggling text, which can't be done with Static text. This means that Dynamic Text takes more processing
       * time, so only use them if you require the callback ability they have.
       *
       * BitmapText objects are less flexible than Text objects, in that they have less features such as shadows, fills and the ability
       * to use Web Fonts, however you trade this flexibility for rendering speed. You can also create visually compelling BitmapTexts by
       * processing the font texture in an image editor, applying fills and any other effects required.
       *
       * To create multi-line text insert \r, \n or \r\n escape codes into the text string.

       * BMFont (Windows, free): http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/

       * DOM Element Game Objects are a way to control and manipulate HTML Elements over the top of your game.
       *
       * In order for DOM Elements to display you have to enable them by adding the following to your game
       * configuration object:
       *
       * ```javascript
       * dom {
       *   createContainer: true
       * }
       * ```
       *
       * When this is added, Phaser will automatically create a DOM Container div that is positioned over the top
       * of the game canvas. This div is sized to match the canvas, and if the canvas size changes, as a result of
       * settings within the Scale Manager, the dom container is resized accordingly.
       *
       * You can create a DOM Element by either passing in DOMStrings, or by passing in a reference to an existing
       * Element that you wish to be placed under the control of Phaser. For example:
       *
       * ```javascript
       * this.add.dom(x, y, 'div', 'background-color: lime; width: 220px; height: 100px; font: 48px Arial', 'Phaser');
       * ```
       *
       * The above code will insert a div element into the DOM Container at the given x/y coordinate. The DOMString in
       * the 4th argument sets the initial CSS style of the div and the final argument is the inner text. In this case,
       * it will create a lime colored div that is 220px by 100px in size with the text Phaser in it, in an Arial font.
       *
       * You should nearly always, without exception, use explicitly sized HTML Elements, in order to fully control
       * alignment and positioning of the elements next to regular game content.
       *
       * Rather than specify the CSS and HTML directly you can use the `load.html` File Loader to load it into the
       * cache and then use the `createFromCache` method instead. You can also use `createFromHTML` and various other
       * methods available in this class to help construct your elements.
       *
       * Once the element has been created you can then control it like you would any other Game Object. You can set its
       * position, scale, rotation, alpha and other properties. It will move as the main Scene Camera moves and be clipped
       * at the edge of the canvas. It's important to remember some limitations of DOM Elements: The obvious one is that
       * they appear above or below your game canvas. You cannot blend them into the display list, meaning you cannot have
       * a DOM Element, then a Sprite, then another DOM Element behind it.
       *
       * They also cannot be enabled for input. To do that, you have to use the `addListener` method to add native event
       * listeners directly. The final limitation is to do with cameras. The DOM Container is sized to match the game canvas
       * entirely and clipped accordingly. DOM Elements respect camera scrolling and scrollFactor settings, but if you
       * change the size of the camera so it no longer matches the size of the canvas, they won't be clipped accordingly.
       *
       * Also, all DOM Elements are inserted into the same DOM Container, regardless of which Scene they are created in.
       *
       * DOM Elements are a powerful way to align native HTML with your Phaser Game Objects. For example, you can insert
       * a login form for a multiplayer game directly into your title screen. Or a text input box for a highscore table.
       * Or a banner ad from a 3rd party service. Or perhaps you'd like to use them for high resolution text display and
       * UI. The choice is up to you, just remember that you're dealing with standard HTML and CSS floating over the top
       * of your game, and should treat it accordingly.
       *
       * Note: This method will only be available if the DOM Element Game Object has been built into Phaser.
       * @param x The horizontal position of this DOM Element in the world.
       * @param y The vertical position of this DOM Element in the world.

       * @param style If a string, will be set directly as the elements `style` property value. If a plain object, will be iterated and the values transferred. In both cases the values replacing whatever CSS styles may have been previously set.
       * @param innerText If given, will be set directly as the elements `innerText` property value, replacing whatever was there before.

       *
       * Text objects work by creating their own internal hidden Canvas and then renders text to it using
       * the standard Canvas `fillText` API. It then creates a texture from this canvas which is rendered
       * to your game during the render pass.
       *
       * Because it uses the Canvas API you can take advantage of all the features this offers, such as
       * applying gradient fills to the text, or strokes, shadows and more. You can also use custom fonts
       * loaded externally, such as Google or TypeKit Web fonts.
       *
       * You can only display fonts that are currently loaded and available to the browser: therefore fonts must
       * be pre-loaded. Phaser does not do ths for you, so you will require the use of a 3rd party font loader,
       * or have the fonts ready available in the CSS on the page in which your Phaser game resides.
       *
       * See {@link http://www.jordanm.co.uk/tinytype this compatibility table} for the available default fonts
       * across mobile browsers.
       *
       * A note on performance: Every time the contents of a Text object changes, i.e. changing the text being
       * displayed, or the style of the text, it needs to remake the Text canvas, and if on WebGL, re-upload the
       * new texture to the GPU. This can be an expensive operation if used often, or with large quantities of
       * Text objects in your game. If you run into performance issues you would be better off using Bitmap Text
       * instead, as it benefits from batching and avoids expensive Canvas API calls.

     * A Graphics object is a way to draw primitive shapes to your game. Primitives include forms of geometry, such as
     * Rectangles, Circles, and Polygons. They also include lines, arcs and curves. When you initially create a Graphics
     * object it will be empty.
     *
     * To draw to it you must first specify a line style or fill style (or both), draw shapes using paths, and finally
     * fill or stroke them. For example:
     *
     * ```javascript
     * graphics.lineStyle(5, 0xFF00FF, 1.0);
     * graphics.beginPath();
     * graphics.moveTo(100, 100);
     * graphics.lineTo(200, 200);
     * graphics.closePath();
     * graphics.strokePath();
     * ```
     *
     * There are also many helpful methods that draw and fill/stroke common shapes for you.
     *
     * ```javascript
     * graphics.lineStyle(5, 0xFF00FF, 1.0);
     * graphics.fillStyle(0xFFFFFF, 1.0);
     * graphics.fillRect(50, 50, 400, 200);
     * graphics.strokeRect(50, 50, 400, 200);
     * ```
     *
     * When a Graphics object is rendered it will render differently based on if the game is running under Canvas or WebGL.
     * Under Canvas it will use the HTML Canvas context drawing operations to draw the path.
     * Under WebGL the graphics data is decomposed into polygons. Both of these are expensive processes, especially with
     * complex shapes.
     *
     * If your Graphics object doesn't change much (or at all) once you've drawn your shape to it, then you will help
     * performance by calling {@link Phaser.GameObjects.Graphics#generateTexture}. This will 'bake' the Graphics object into
     * a Texture, and return it. You can then use this Texture for Sprites or other display objects. If your Graphics object
     * updates frequently then you should avoid doing this, as it will constantly generate new textures, which will consume
     * memory.
     *
     * As you can tell, Graphics objects are a bit of a trade-off. While they are extremely useful, you need to be careful
     * in their complexity and quantity of them in your game.

     * A Shader Game Object.
     *
     * This Game Object allows you to easily add a quad with its own shader into the display list, and manipulate it
     * as you would any other Game Object, including scaling, rotating, positioning and adding to Containers. Shaders
     * can be masked with either Bitmap or Geometry masks and can also be used as a Bitmap Mask for a Camera or other
     * Game Object. They can also be made interactive and used for input events.
     *
     * It works by taking a reference to a `Phaser.Display.BaseShader` instance, as found in the Shader Cache. These can
     * be created dynamically at runtime, or loaded in via the GLSL File Loader:
     *
     * ```javascript
     * function preload ()
     * {
     *     this.load.glsl('fire', 'shaders/fire.glsl.js');
     * }
     *
     * function create ()
     * {
     *     this.add.shader('fire', 400, 300, 512, 512);
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * Please see the Phaser 3 Examples GitHub repo for examples of loading and creating shaders dynamically.
     *
     * Due to the way in which they work, you cannot directly change the alpha or blend mode of a Shader. This should
     * be handled via exposed uniforms in the shader code itself.
     *
     * By default a Shader will be created with a standard set of uniforms. These were added to match those
     * found on sites such as ShaderToy or GLSLSandbox, and provide common functionality a shader may need,
     * such as the timestamp, resolution or pointer position. You can replace them by specifying your own uniforms
     * in the Base Shader.
     *
     * These Shaders work by halting the current pipeline during rendering, creating a viewport matched to the
     * size of this Game Object and then renders a quad using the bound shader. At the end, the pipeline is restored.
     *
     * Because it blocks the pipeline it means it will interrupt any batching that is currently going on, so you should
     * use these Game Objects sparingly. If you need to have a fully batched custom shader, then please look at using
     * a custom pipeline instead. However, for background or special masking effects, they are extremely effective.

    /**
     * A Text Game Object.
     *
     * Text objects work by creating their own internal hidden Canvas and then renders text to it using
     * the standard Canvas `fillText` API. It then creates a texture from this canvas which is rendered
     * to your game during the render pass.
     *
     * Because it uses the Canvas API you can take advantage of all the features this offers, such as
     * applying gradient fills to the text, or strokes, shadows and more. You can also use custom fonts
     * loaded externally, such as Google or TypeKit Web fonts.
     *
     * **Important:** If the font you wish to use has a space or digit in its name, such as
     * 'Press Start 2P' or 'Roboto Condensed', then you _must_ put the font name in quotes, either
     * when creating the Text object, or when setting the font via `setFont` or `setFontFamily`. I.e.:
     *
     * ```javascript
     * this.add.text(0, 0, 'Hello World', { fontFamily: '"Roboto Condensed"' });
     * ```
     *
     * Equally, if you wish to provide a list of fallback fonts, then you should ensure they are all
     * quoted properly, too:
     *
     * ```javascript
     * this.add.text(0, 0, 'Hello World', { fontFamily: 'Verdana, "Times New Roman", Tahoma, serif' });
     * ```
     *
     * You can only display fonts that are currently loaded and available to the browser: therefore fonts must
     * be pre-loaded. Phaser does not do ths for you, so you will require the use of a 3rd party font loader,
     * or have the fonts ready available in the CSS on the page in which your Phaser game resides.
     *
     * See {@link http://www.jordanm.co.uk/tinytype this compatibility table} for the available default fonts
     * across mobile browsers.
     *
     * A note on performance: Every time the contents of a Text object changes, i.e. changing the text being
     * displayed, or the style of the text, it needs to remake the Text canvas, and if on WebGL, re-upload the
     * new texture to the GPU. This can be an expensive operation if used often, or with large quantities of
     * Text objects in your game. If you run into performance issues you would be better off using Bitmap Text
     * instead, as it benefits from batching and avoids expensive Canvas API calls.

     * A TileSprite is a Sprite that has a repeating texture.
     *
     * The texture can be scrolled and scaled independently of the TileSprite itself. Textures will automatically wrap and
     * are designed so that you can create game backdrops using seamless textures as a source.
     *
     * You shouldn't ever create a TileSprite any larger than your actual canvas size. If you want to create a large repeating background
     * that scrolls across the whole map of your game, then you create a TileSprite that fits the canvas size and then use the `tilePosition`
     * property to scroll the texture as the player moves. If you create a TileSprite that is thousands of pixels in size then it will
     * consume huge amounts of memory and cause performance issues. Remember: use `tilePosition` to scroll your texture and `tileScale` to
     * adjust the scale of the texture - don't resize the sprite itself or make it larger than it needs.
     *
     * An important note about Tile Sprites and NPOT textures: Internally, TileSprite textures use GL_REPEAT to provide
     * seamless repeating of the textures. This, combined with the way in which the textures are handled in WebGL, means
     * they need to be POT (power-of-two) sizes in order to wrap. If you provide a NPOT (non power-of-two) texture to a
     * TileSprite it will generate a POT sized canvas and draw your texture to it, scaled up to the POT size. It's then
     * scaled back down again during rendering to the original dimensions. While this works, in that it allows you to use
     * any size texture for a Tile Sprite, it does mean that NPOT textures are going to appear anti-aliased when rendered,
     * due to the interpolation that took place when it was resized into a POT texture. This is especially visible in
     * pixel art graphics. If you notice it and it becomes an issue, the only way to avoid it is to ensure that you
     * provide POT textures for Tile Sprites.

       * The Gamepad Plugin is an input plugin that belongs to the Scene-owned Input system.
       *
       * Its role is to listen for native DOM Gamepad Events and then process them.
       *
       * You do not need to create this class directly, the Input system will create an instance of it automatically.
       *
       * You can access it from within a Scene using `this.input.gamepad`.
       *
       * To listen for a gamepad being connected:
       *
       * ```javascript
       * this.input.gamepad.once('connected', function (pad) {
       *     //   'pad' is a reference to the gamepad that was just connected
       * });
       * ```
       *
       * Note that the browser may require you to press a button on a gamepad before it will allow you to access it,
       * this is for security reasons. However, it may also trust the page already, in which case you won't get the
       * 'connected' event and instead should check `GamepadPlugin.total` to see if it thinks there are any gamepads
       * already connected.
       *
       * Once you have received the connected event, or polled the gamepads and found them enabled, you can access
       * them via the built-in properties `GamepadPlugin.pad1` to `pad4`, for up to 4 game pads. With a reference
       * to the gamepads you can poll its buttons and axis sticks. See the properties and methods available on
       * the `Gamepad` class for more details.

      /**
       * The Keyboard Plugin is an input plugin that belongs to the Scene-owned Input system.
       *
       * Its role is to listen for native DOM Keyboard Events and then process them.
       *
       * You do not need to create this class directly, the Input system will create an instance of it automatically.
       *
       * You can access it from within a Scene using `this.input.keyboard`. For example, you can do:
       *
       * ```javascript
       * this.input.keyboard.on('keydown', callback, context);
       * ```
       *
       * Or, to listen for a specific key:
       *
       * ```javascript
       * this.input.keyboard.on('keydown-A', callback, context);
       * ```
       *
       * You can also create Key objects, which you can then poll in your game loop:
       *
       * ```javascript
       * var spaceBar = this.input.keyboard.addKey(Phaser.Input.Keyboard.KeyCodes.SPACE);
       * ```
       *
       * If you have multiple parallel Scenes, each trying to get keyboard input, be sure to disable capture on them to stop them from
       * stealing input from another Scene in the list. You can do this with `this.input.keyboard.enabled = false` within the
       * Scene to stop all input, or `this.input.keyboard.preventDefault = false` to stop a Scene halting input on another Scene.
       *
       * _Note_: Many keyboards are unable to process certain combinations of keys due to hardware limitations known as ghosting.
       * See http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/4876-impossible-to-use-more-than-2-keyboard-input-buttons-at-the-same-time/ for more details.
       *
       * Also please be aware that certain browser extensions can disable or override Phaser keyboard handling.
       * For example the Chrome extension vimium is known to disable Phaser from using the D key, while EverNote disables the backtick key.
       * And there are others. So, please check your extensions before opening Phaser issues about keys that don't work.

     * The Loader handles loading all external content such as Images, Sounds, Texture Atlases and data files.
     * You typically interact with it via `this.load` in your Scene. Scenes can have a `preload` method, which is always
     * called before the Scenes `create` method, allowing you to preload assets that the Scene may need.
     *
     * If you call any `this.load` methods from outside of `Scene.preload` then you need to start the Loader going
     * yourself by calling `Loader.start()`. It's only automatically started during the Scene preload.
     *
     * The Loader uses a combination of tag loading (eg. Audio elements) and XHR and provides progress and completion events.
     * Files are loaded in parallel by default. The amount of concurrent connections can be controlled in your Game Configuration.
     *
     * Once the Loader has started loading you are still able to add files to it. These can be injected as a result of a loader
     * event, the type of file being loaded (such as a pack file) or other external events. As long as the Loader hasn't finished
     * simply adding a new file to it, while running, will ensure it's added into the current queue.
     *
     * Every Scene has its own instance of the Loader and they are bound to the Scene in which they are created. However,
     * assets loaded by the Loader are placed into global game-level caches. For example, loading an XML file will place that
     * file inside `Game.cache.xml`, which is accessible from every Scene in your game, no matter who was responsible
     * for loading it. The same is true of Textures. A texture loaded in one Scene is instantly available to all other Scenes
     * in your game.
     *
     * The Loader works by using custom File Types. These are stored in the FileTypesManager, which injects them into the Loader
     * when it's instantiated. You can create your own custom file types by extending either the File or MultiFile classes.
     * See those files for more details.

       *

       *
       * ```javascript

       *     this.load.animation('baddieAnims', 'files/BaddieAnims.json');
       * }
       * ```
       *
       * The file is **not** loaded right away. It is added to a queue ready to be loaded either when the loader starts,
       * or if it's already running, when the next free load slot becomes available. This happens automatically if you
       * are calling this from within the Scene's `preload` method, or a related callback. Because the file is queued
       * it means you cannot use the file immediately after calling this method, but must wait for the file to complete.
       * The typical flow for a Phaser Scene is that you load assets in the Scene's `preload` method and then when the
       * Scene's `create` method is called you are guaranteed that all of those assets are ready for use and have been
       * loaded.
       *
       * If you call this from outside of `preload` then you are responsible for starting the Loader afterwards and monitoring
       * its events to know when it's safe to use the asset. Please see the Phaser.Loader.LoaderPlugin class for more details.
       *
       * The key must be a unique String. It is used to add the file to the global JSON Cache upon a successful load.
       * The key should be unique both in terms of files being loaded and files already present in the JSON Cache.
       * Loading a file using a key that is already taken will result in a warning. If you wish to replace an existing file
       * then remove it from the JSON Cache first, before loading a new one.
       *
       * Instead of passing arguments you can pass a configuration object, such as:
       *
       * ```javascript
       * this.load.animation({
       *     key: 'baddieAnims',
       *     url: 'files/BaddieAnims.json'
       * });
       * ```
       *
       * See the documentation for `Phaser.Types.Loader.FileTypes.JSONFileConfig` for more details.
       *
       * Once the file has finished loading it will automatically be passed to the global Animation Managers `fromJSON` method.
       * This will parse all of the JSON data and create animation data from it. This process happens at the very end
       * of the Loader, once every other file in the load queue has finished. The reason for this is to allow you to load
       * both animation data and the images it relies upon in the same load call.
       *
       * Once the animation data has been parsed you will be able to play animations using that data.
       * Please see the Animation Manager `fromJSON` method for more details about the format and playback.
       *
       * You can also access the raw animation data from its Cache using its key:
       *
       * ```javascript
       * this.load.animation('baddieAnims', 'files/BaddieAnims.json');
       * // and later in your game ...
       * var data = this.cache.json.get('baddieAnims');
       * ```
       *
       * If you have specified a prefix in the loader, via `Loader.setPrefix` then this value will be prepended to this files
       * key. For example, if the prefix was `LEVEL1.` and the key was `Waves` the final key will be `LEVEL1.Waves` and
       * this is what you would use to retrieve the text from the JSON Cache.
       *
       * The URL can be relative or absolute. If the URL is relative the `Loader.baseURL` and `Loader.path` values will be prepended to it.
       *
       * If the URL isn't specified the Loader will take the key and create a filename from that. For example if the key is "data"
       * and no URL is given then the Loader will set the URL to be "data.json". It will always add `.json` as the extension, although
       * this can be overridden if using an object instead of method arguments. If you do not desire this action then provide a URL.
       *
       * You can also optionally provide a `dataKey` to use. This allows you to extract only a part of the JSON and store it in the Cache,
       * rather than the whole file. For example, if your JSON data had a structure like this:
       *
       * ```json
       * {
       *     "level1": {
       *         "baddies": {
       *             "aliens": {},
       *             "boss": {}

       *     "level2": {},
       *     "level3": {}
       * }
       * ```
       *
       * And if you only wanted to create animations from the `boss` data, then you could pass `level1.baddies.boss`as the `dataKey`.
       *
       * Note: The ability to load this type of file will only be available if the JSON File type has been built into Phaser.
       * It is available in the default build but can be excluded from custom builds.
       * @param key The key to use for this file, or a file configuration object, or array of them.
       * @param url The absolute or relative URL to load this file from. If undefined or `null` it will be set to `<key>.json`, i.e. if `key` was "alien" then the URL will be "alien.json".
       * @param dataKey When the Animation JSON file loads only this property will be stored in the Cache and used to create animation data.

       * are calling this from within the Scene's `preload` method, or a related callback. Because the file is queued
       * it means you cannot use the file immediately after calling this method, but must wait for the file to complete.
       * The typical flow for a Phaser Scene is that you load assets in the Scene's `preload` method and then when the
       * Scene's `create` method is called you are guaranteed that all of those assets are ready for use and have been
       * loaded.
       *
       * If you call this from outside of `preload` then you are responsible for starting the Loader afterwards and monitoring
       * its events to know when it's safe to use the asset. Please see the Phaser.Loader.LoaderPlugin class for more details.
       *
       * Phaser expects the atlas data to be provided in an XML file format.
       * These files are created by software such as Shoebox and Adobe Flash / Animate.
       *
       * Phaser can load all common image types: png, jpg, gif and any other format the browser can natively handle.
       *
       * The key must be a unique String. It is used to add the file to the global Texture Manager upon a successful load.
       * The key should be unique both in terms of files being loaded and files already present in the Texture Manager.
       * Loading a file using a key that is already taken will result in a warning. If you wish to replace an existing file
       * then remove it from the Texture Manager first, before loading a new one.
       *
       * Instead of passing arguments you can pass a configuration object, such as:
       *
       * ```javascript
       * this.load.atlasXML({
       *     key: 'mainmenu',

       * See the documentation for `Phaser.Types.Loader.FileTypes.AtlasXMLFileConfig` for more details.
       *
       * Once the atlas has finished loading you can use frames from it as textures for a Game Object by referencing its key:
       *
       * ```javascript
       * this.load.atlasXML('mainmenu', 'images/MainMenu.png', 'images/MainMenu.xml');

       * ```
       *
       * To get a list of all available frames within an atlas please consult your Texture Atlas software.
       *
       * If you have specified a prefix in the loader, via `Loader.setPrefix` then this value will be prepended to this files
       * key. For example, if the prefix was `MENU.` and the key was `Background` the final key will be `MENU.Background` and
       * this is what you would use to retrieve the image from the Texture Manager.
       *
       * The URL can be relative or absolute. If the URL is relative the `Loader.baseURL` and `Loader.path` values will be prepended to it.

       * If you call this from outside of `preload` then you are responsible for starting the Loader afterwards and monitoring
       * its events to know when it's safe to use the asset. Please see the Phaser.Loader.LoaderPlugin class for more details.
       *
       * Phaser expects the font data to be provided in an XML file format.
       * These files are created by software such as the [Angelcode Bitmap Font Generator](http://www.angelcode.com/products/bmfont/),
       * [Littera](http://kvazars.com/littera/) or [Glyph Designer](https://71squared.com/glyphdesigner)
       *
       * Phaser can load all common image types: png, jpg, gif and any other format the browser can natively handle.
       *
       * The key must be a unique String. It is used to add the file to the global Texture Manager upon a successful load.
       * The key should be unique both in terms of files being loaded and files already present in the Texture Manager.
       * Loading a file using a key that is already taken will result in a warning. If you wish to replace an existing file
       * then remove it from the Texture Manager first, before loading a new one.
       *
       * Instead of passing arguments you can pass a configuration object, such as:
       *
       * ```javascript
       * this.load.bitmapFont({
       *     key: 'goldenFont',
       *     textureURL: 'images/GoldFont.png',
       *     fontDataURL: 'images/GoldFont.xml'
       * });
       * ```
       *
       * See the documentation for `Phaser.Types.Loader.FileTypes.BitmapFontFileConfig` for more details.
       *
       * Once the atlas has finished loading you can use key of it when creating a Bitmap Text Game Object:
       *
       * ```javascript
       * this.load.bitmapFont('goldenFont', 'images/GoldFont.png', 'images/GoldFont.xml');
       * // and later in your game ...
       * this.add.bitmapText(x, y, 'goldenFont', 'Hello World');
       * ```
       *
       * If you have specified a prefix in the loader, via `Loader.setPrefix` then this value will be prepended to this files
       * key. For example, if the prefix was `MENU.` and the key was `Background` the final key will be `MENU.Background` and
       * this is what you would use when creating a Bitmap Text object.
       *
       * The URL can be relative or absolute. If the URL is relative the `Loader.baseURL` and `Loader.path` values will be prepended to it.
       *
       * If the URL isn't specified the Loader will take the key and create a filename from that. For example if the key is "alien"
       * and no URL is given then the Loader will set the URL to be "alien.png". It will always add `.png` as the extension, although
       * this can be overridden if using an object instead of method arguments. If you do not desire this action then provide a URL.
       *
       * Phaser also supports the automatic loading of associated normal maps. If you have a normal map to go with this image,
       * then you can specify it by providing an array as the `url` where the second element is the normal map:
       *
       * ```javascript
       * this.load.bitmapFont('goldenFont', [ 'images/GoldFont.png', 'images/GoldFont-n.png' ], 'images/GoldFont.xml');
       * ```
       *
       * Or, if you are using a config object use the `normalMap` property:
       *
       * ```javascript
       * this.load.bitmapFont({
       *     key: 'goldenFont',
       *     textureURL: 'images/GoldFont.png',
       *     normalMap: 'images/GoldFont-n.png',
       *     fontDataURL: 'images/GoldFont.xml'
       * });
       * ```
       *
       * The normal map file is subject to the same conditions as the image file with regard to the path, baseURL, CORs and XHR Settings.
       * Normal maps are a WebGL only feature.
       *
       * Note: The ability to load this type of file will only be available if the Bitmap Font File type has been built into Phaser.
       * It is available in the default build but can be excluded from custom builds.
       * @param key The key to use for this file, or a file configuration object, or array of them.
       * @param textureURL The absolute or relative URL to load the font image file from. If undefined or `null` it will be set to `<key>.png`, i.e. if `key` was "alien" then the URL will be "alien.png".
       * @param fontDataURL The absolute or relative URL to load the font xml data file from. If undefined or `null` it will be set to `<key>.xml`, i.e. if `key` was "alien" then the URL will be "alien.xml".
       * @param textureXhrSettings An XHR Settings configuration object for the font image file. Used in replacement of the Loaders default XHR Settings.
       * @param fontDataXhrSettings An XHR Settings configuration object for the font data xml file. Used in replacement of the Loaders default XHR Settings.

       * Loading a file using a key that is already taken will result in a warning. If you wish to replace an existing file
       * then remove it from the Texture Manager first, before loading a new one.
       *
       * Instead of passing arguments you can pass a configuration object, such as:
       *
       * ```javascript
       * this.load.image({
       *     key: 'logo',
       *     url: 'images/AtariLogo.png'
       * });
       * ```
       *
       * See the documentation for `Phaser.Types.Loader.FileTypes.ImageFileConfig` for more details.
       *
       * Once the file has finished loading you can use it as a texture for a Game Object by referencing its key:
       *
       * ```javascript
       * this.load.image('logo', 'images/AtariLogo.png');
       * // and later in your game ...
       * this.add.image(x, y, 'logo');
       * ```
       *
       * If you have specified a prefix in the loader, via `Loader.setPrefix` then this value will be prepended to this files
       * key. For example, if the prefix was `MENU.` and the key was `Background` the final key will be `MENU.Background` and
       * this is what you would use to retrieve the image from the Texture Manager.
       *
       * The URL can be relative or absolute. If the URL is relative the `Loader.baseURL` and `Loader.path` values will be prepended to it.
       *
       * If the URL isn't specified the Loader will take the key and create a filename from that. For example if the key is "alien"
       * and no URL is given then the Loader will set the URL to be "alien.png". It will always add `.png` as the extension, although
       * this can be overridden if using an object instead of method arguments. If you do not desire this action then provide a URL.
       *
       * Phaser also supports the automatic loading of associated normal maps. If you have a normal map to go with this image,
       * then you can specify it by providing an array as the `url` where the second element is the normal map:
       *
       * ```javascript
       * this.load.image('logo', [ 'images/AtariLogo.png', 'images/AtariLogo-n.png' ]);
       * ```
       *
       * Or, if you are using a config object use the `normalMap` property:
       *
       * ```javascript
       * this.load.image({
       *     key: 'logo',
       *     url: 'images/AtariLogo.png',
       *     normalMap: 'images/AtariLogo-n.png'
       * });
       * ```
       *
       * The normal map file is subject to the same conditions as the image file with regard to the path, baseURL, CORs and XHR Settings.
       * Normal maps are a WebGL only feature.
       *
       * Note: The ability to load this type of file will only be available if the Image File type has been built into Phaser.
       * It is available in the default build but can be excluded from custom builds.
       * @param key The key to use for this file, or a file configuration object, or array of them.
       * @param url The absolute or relative URL to load this file from. If undefined or `null` it will be set to `<key>.png`, i.e. if `key` was "alien" then the URL will be "alien.png".
       * @param xhrSettings An XHR Settings configuration object. Used in replacement of the Loaders default XHR Settings.

       * or if it's already running, when the next free load slot becomes available. This happens automatically if you
       * are calling this from within the Scene's `preload` method, or a related callback. Because the file is queued
       * it means you cannot use the file immediately after calling this method, but must wait for the file to complete.

       * Scene's `create` method is called you are guaranteed that all of those assets are ready for use and have been

       * this can be overridden if using an object instead of method arguments. If you do not desire this action then provide a URL.
       *
       * You can also optionally provide a `dataKey` to use. This allows you to extract only a part of the JSON and store it in the Cache,
       * rather than the whole file. For example, if your JSON data had a structure like this:
       *
       * ```json
       * {

       * Phaser expects the atlas data to be provided in a JSON file as exported from the application Texture Packer,
       * version 4.6.3 or above, where you have made sure to use the Phaser 3 Export option.
       *
       * The way it works internally is that you provide a URL to the JSON file. Phaser then loads this JSON, parses it and

       * ```
       *
       * A File Pack is a JSON file (or object) that contains details about other files that should be added into the Loader.
       * Here is a small example:
       *
       * ```json
       * {
       *    "test1": {
       *        "files": [

       * The pack can be split into sections. In the example above you'll see a section called `test1. You can tell
       * the `load.pack` method to parse only a particular section of a pack. The pack is stored in the JSON Cache,

       *
       * The URL can be relative or absolute. If the URL is relative the `Loader.baseURL` and `Loader.path` values will be prepended to it.
       *
       * If the URL isn't specified the Loader will take the key and create a filename from that. For example if the key is "data"
       * and no URL is given then the Loader will set the URL to be "data.json". It will always add `.json` as the extension, although
       * this can be overridden if using an object instead of method arguments. If you do not desire this action then provide a URL.
       *
       * You can also optionally provide a `dataKey` to use. This allows you to extract only a part of the JSON and store it in the Cache,
       * rather than the whole file. For example, if your JSON data had a structure like this:
       *
       * ```json
       * {
       *     "level1": {
       *         "baddies": {
       *             "aliens": {},
       *             "boss": {}

       *     "level2": {},
       *     "level3": {}
       * }
       * ```
       *
       * And you only wanted to store the `boss` data in the Cache, then you could pass `level1.baddies.boss`as the `dataKey`.
       *

       * are calling this from within the Scene's `preload` method, or a related callback. Because the file is queued
       * it means you cannot use the file immediately after calling this method, but must wait for the file to complete.
       * The typical flow for a Phaser Scene is that you load assets in the Scene's `preload` method and then when the
       * Scene's `create` method is called you are guaranteed that all of those assets are ready for use and have been
       * loaded.
       *
       * The key must be a unique String and not already in-use by another file in the Loader.

       * See the documentation for `Phaser.Types.Loader.FileTypes.PluginFileConfig` for more details.
       *
       * Once the file has finished loading it will automatically be converted into a script element
       * via `document.createElement('script')`. It will have its language set to JavaScript, `defer` set to
       * false and then the resulting element will be appended to `document.head`. Any code then in the

       * loaded.
       *
       * The key must be a unique String. It is used to add the file to the global Scene Manager upon a successful load.
       *
       * For a Scene File it's vitally important that the key matches the class name in the JavaScript file.
       *
       * For example here is the source file:
       *
       * ```javascript
       * class ExternalScene extends Phaser.Scene {
       *
       *     constructor ()
       *     {
       *         super('myScene');
       *     }
       *
       * }
       * ```
       *
       * Because the class is called `ExternalScene` that is the exact same key you must use when loading it:
       *
       * ```javascript
       * function preload ()
       * {
       *     this.load.sceneFile('ExternalScene', 'src/yourScene.js');
       * }
       * ```
       *
       * The key that is used within the Scene Manager can either be set to the same, or you can override it in the Scene
       * constructor, as we've done in the example above, where the Scene key was changed to `myScene`.
       *
       * The key should be unique both in terms of files being loaded and Scenes already present in the Scene Manager.
       * Loading a file using a key that is already taken will result in a warning. If you wish to replace an existing file
       * then remove it from the Scene Manager first, before loading a new one.
       *
       * Instead of passing arguments you can pass a configuration object, such as:
       *
       * ```javascript
       * this.load.sceneFile({
       *     key: 'Level1',
       *     url: 'src/Level1.js'
       * });
       * ```
       *
       * See the documentation for `Phaser.Types.Loader.FileTypes.SceneFileConfig` for more details.
       *
       * Once the file has finished loading it will be added to the Scene Manager.
       *
       * ```javascript
       * this.load.sceneFile('Level1', 'src/Level1.js');
       * // and later in your game ...
       * this.scene.start('Level1');
       * ```
       *
       * If you have specified a prefix in the loader, via `Loader.setPrefix` then this value will be prepended to this files
       * key. For example, if the prefix was `WORLD1.` and the key was `Story` the final key will be `WORLD1.Story` and
       * this is what you would use to retrieve the text from the Scene Manager.
       *
       * The URL can be relative or absolute. If the URL is relative the `Loader.baseURL` and `Loader.path` values will be prepended to it.

       * this can be overridden if using an object instead of method arguments. If you do not desire this action then provide a URL.
       *
       * Phaser also supports the automatic loading of associated normal maps. If you have a normal map to go with this image,
       * then you can specify it by providing an array as the `url` where the second element is the normal map:

      /**
       * Adds an SVG File, or array of SVG Files, to the current load queue. When the files are loaded they
       * will be rendered to bitmap textures and stored in the Texture Manager.
       *
       * You can call this method from within your Scene's `preload`, along with any other files you wish to load:
       *
       * ```javascript
       * function preload ()
       * {
       *     this.load.svg('morty', 'images/Morty.svg');
       * }
       * ```
       *
       * The file is **not** loaded right away. It is added to a queue ready to be loaded either when the loader starts,
       * or if it's already running, when the next free load slot becomes available. This happens automatically if you
       * are calling this from within the Scene's `preload` method, or a related callback. Because the file is queued
       * it means you cannot use the file immediately after calling this method, but must wait for the file to complete.
       * The typical flow for a Phaser Scene is that you load assets in the Scene's `preload` method and then when the
       * Scene's `create` method is called you are guaranteed that all of those assets are ready for use and have been
       * loaded.
       *
       * The key must be a unique String. It is used to add the file to the global Texture Manager upon a successful load.
       * The key should be unique both in terms of files being loaded and files already present in the Texture Manager.
       * Loading a file using a key that is already taken will result in a warning. If you wish to replace an existing file
       * then remove it from the Texture Manager first, before loading a new one.
       *
       * Instead of passing arguments you can pass a configuration object, such as:
       *
       * ```javascript
       * this.load.svg({
       *     key: 'morty',
       *     url: 'images/Morty.svg'
       * });
       * ```
       *
       * See the documentation for `Phaser.Types.Loader.FileTypes.SVGFileConfig` for more details.
       *
       * Once the file has finished loading you can use it as a texture for a Game Object by referencing its key:
       *
       * ```javascript
       * this.load.svg('morty', 'images/Morty.svg');
       * // and later in your game ...
       * this.add.image(x, y, 'morty');
       * ```
       *
       * If you have specified a prefix in the loader, via `Loader.setPrefix` then this value will be prepended to this files
       * key. For example, if the prefix was `MENU.` and the key was `Background` the final key will be `MENU.Background` and
       * this is what you would use to retrieve the image from the Texture Manager.
       *
       * The URL can be relative or absolute. If the URL is relative the `Loader.baseURL` and `Loader.path` values will be prepended to it.
       *
       * If the URL isn't specified the Loader will take the key and create a filename from that. For example if the key is "alien"
       * and no URL is given then the Loader will set the URL to be "alien.html". It will always add `.html` as the extension, although
       * this can be overridden if using an object instead of method arguments. If you do not desire this action then provide a URL.
       *
       * You can optionally pass an SVG Resize Configuration object when you load an SVG file. By default the SVG will be rendered to a texture
       * at the same size defined in the SVG file attributes. However, this isn't always desirable. You may wish to resize the SVG (either down
       * or up) to improve texture clarity, or reduce texture memory consumption. You can either specify an exact width and height to resize
       * the SVG to:
       *
       * ```javascript
       * function preload ()
       * {
       *     this.load.svg('morty', 'images/Morty.svg', { width: 300, height: 600 });
       * }
       * ```
       *
       * Or when using a configuration object:
       *
       * ```javascript
       * this.load.svg({
       *     key: 'morty',
       *     url: 'images/Morty.svg',
       *     svgConfig: {
       *         width: 300,
       *         height: 600
       *     }
       * });
       * ```
       *
       * Alternatively, you can just provide a scale factor instead:
       *
       * ```javascript
       * function preload ()
       * {
       *     this.load.svg('morty', 'images/Morty.svg', { scale: 2.5 });
       * }
       * ```
       *
       * Or when using a configuration object:
       *
       * ```javascript
       * this.load.svg({
       *     key: 'morty',
       *     url: 'images/Morty.svg',
       *     svgConfig: {
       *         scale: 2.5
       *     }
       * });
       * ```
       *
       * If scale, width and height values are all given, the scale has priority and the width and height values are ignored.
       *

      /**
       * Adds a Unity YAML based Texture Atlas, or array of atlases, to the current load queue.
       *
       * You can call this method from within your Scene's `preload`, along with any other files you wish to load:
       *
       * ```javascript
       * function preload ()
       * {
       *     this.load.unityAtlas('mainmenu', 'images/MainMenu.png', 'images/MainMenu.txt');
       * }
       * ```
       *
       * The file is **not** loaded right away. It is added to a queue ready to be loaded either when the loader starts,
       * or if it's already running, when the next free load slot becomes available. This happens automatically if you
       * are calling this from within the Scene's `preload` method, or a related callback. Because the file is queued
       * it means you cannot use the file immediately after calling this method, but must wait for the file to complete.
       * The typical flow for a Phaser Scene is that you load assets in the Scene's `preload` method and then when the
       * Scene's `create` method is called you are guaranteed that all of those assets are ready for use and have been
       * loaded.
       *
       * If you call this from outside of `preload` then you are responsible for starting the Loader afterwards and monitoring
       * its events to know when it's safe to use the asset. Please see the Phaser.Loader.LoaderPlugin class for more details.
       *
       * Phaser expects the atlas data to be provided in a YAML formatted text file as exported from Unity.
       *
       * Phaser can load all common image types: png, jpg, gif and any other format the browser can natively handle.
       *
       * The key must be a unique String. It is used to add the file to the global Texture Manager upon a successful load.
       * The key should be unique both in terms of files being loaded and files already present in the Texture Manager.
       * Loading a file using a key that is already taken will result in a warning. If you wish to replace an existing file
       * then remove it from the Texture Manager first, before loading a new one.
       *
       * Instead of passing arguments you can pass a configuration object, such as:
       *
       * ```javascript
       * this.load.unityAtlas({
       *     key: 'mainmenu',
       *     textureURL: 'images/MainMenu.png',
       *     atlasURL: 'images/MainMenu.txt'
       * });
       * ```
       *
       * See the documentation for `Phaser.Types.Loader.FileTypes.UnityAtlasFileConfig` for more details.
       *
       * Once the atlas has finished loading you can use frames from it as textures for a Game Object by referencing its key:
       *
       * ```javascript
       * this.load.unityAtlas('mainmenu', 'images/MainMenu.png', 'images/MainMenu.json');
       * // and later in your game ...
       * this.add.image(x, y, 'mainmenu', 'background');
       * ```
       *
       * To get a list of all available frames within an atlas please consult your Texture Atlas software.
       *
       * If you have specified a prefix in the loader, via `Loader.setPrefix` then this value will be prepended to this files
       * key. For example, if the prefix was `MENU.` and the key was `Background` the final key will be `MENU.Background` and
       * this is what you would use to retrieve the image from the Texture Manager.
       *
       * The URL can be relative or absolute. If the URL is relative the `Loader.baseURL` and `Loader.path` values will be prepended to it.
       *
       * If the URL isn't specified the Loader will take the key and create a filename from that. For example if the key is "alien"
       * and no URL is given then the Loader will set the URL to be "alien.png". It will always add `.png` as the extension, although
       * this can be overridden if using an object instead of method arguments. If you do not desire this action then provide a URL.
       *
       * Phaser also supports the automatic loading of associated normal maps. If you have a normal map to go with this image,
       * then you can specify it by providing an array as the `url` where the second element is the normal map:
       *
       * ```javascript
       * this.load.unityAtlas('mainmenu', [ 'images/MainMenu.png', 'images/MainMenu-n.png' ], 'images/MainMenu.txt');
       * ```
       *
       * Or, if you are using a config object use the `normalMap` property:
       *
       * ```javascript
       * this.load.unityAtlas({
       *     key: 'mainmenu',
       *     textureURL: 'images/MainMenu.png',
       *     normalMap: 'images/MainMenu-n.png',
       *     atlasURL: 'images/MainMenu.txt'
       * });
       * ```
       *
       * The normal map file is subject to the same conditions as the image file with regard to the path, baseURL, CORs and XHR Settings.
       * Normal maps are a WebGL only feature.
       *
       * Note: The ability to load this type of file will only be available if the Unity Atlas File type has been built into Phaser.
       * It is available in the default build but can be excluded from custom builds.
       * @param key The key to use for this file, or a file configuration object, or array of them.
       * @param textureURL The absolute or relative URL to load the texture image file from. If undefined or `null` it will be set to `<key>.png`, i.e. if `key` was "alien" then the URL will be "alien.png".
       * @param atlasURL The absolute or relative URL to load the texture atlas data file from. If undefined or `null` it will be set to `<key>.txt`, i.e. if `key` was "alien" then the URL will be "alien.txt".
       * @param textureXhrSettings An XHR Settings configuration object for the atlas image file. Used in replacement of the Loaders default XHR Settings.
       * @param atlasXhrSettings An XHR Settings configuration object for the atlas data file. Used in replacement of the Loaders default XHR Settings.
